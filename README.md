## Overview

**RiverChaos** is a numerical model that explores the potential chaotic behavior of meandering rivers. The model is based on deterministic geometric meandering equations and investigates whether river meandering exhibits characteristics of deterministic chaos. Specifically, this project examines:

- **Boundedness** of meandering systems  
- **Sensitivity to initial conditions**  
- **The role of cutoffs** in chaotic behavior  

This repository contains the source code, figures, and analyses based on an ongoing research project.
